### Hi there 👋

My name is Max Sahm.
On the internet I mostly go by max1220.

You've found my GitHub profile.
On here I mostly put my personal projects that *sometimes* *maybe* **eventually** are useful in some small way.


- ⌨ I’m currently working on PinePhone-related stuff
- 🌕 My main game is Lua
- 🌊 For that, I also learned & now love C.
- 👊 I’m also writing a lot of Bash scripts ...
- 🌐 I learned HTML when I was 8 and I [still regret it](https://max1220.de)
- 🐧 I always use Linux, except sometimes for games. Linux is cool 🕶


You can reach me by writing an e-mail to `max@max1220.de`.
I'm a native german speaker, and I also speak english.
