### Hi there 👋

My name is Max Sahm.
On the Internet™ I go by max1220.

You've found my GitHub profile.
Here I publish my software projects, usually developed just for fun or to solve some problem I have.


- ⌨ I’m currently working on a small CPU design called t3lc
- 🌕 My programming language of choice is Lua
- 🌊 For Lua I've also learned & now am fluent in C.
- 👊 I’m also writing a lot of Bash scripts ...
- 🌐 I've learned HTML when I was 8, some [CSS](https://max1220.de/css/) and JS later
- 🐧 I mostly use Debian Linux. Linux is cool 🕶

I have a homepage at [max1220.de](https://max-sahm.de).

You can reach me by writing an e-mail to `max@max1220.de`.
I'm a native german speaker, and I'm also fluent in english. 

Issues, comments, pull requests, etc. are always welcome!

Have a nice day :)
