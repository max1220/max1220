## WIP v3 branch!
### work-in-progress

This is the development branch for version 3, it is very much work-in-progress.
It's still some missing documentation and test cases. Some stuff might be old.
There is some ammount of cruft. 

Here are some Videos of some stuff that works:

 * [UI Demo](https://youtu.be/qybl-tVnRZM)
 * [Small Demos](https://youtu.be/WMU2HRWPvu4)
 * [Isometric Minecraft Classic Client](https://youtu.be/CqMMpxPkReE)
 * [Framebuffer Window manager(old)](https://youtube.be/6BSQNjJ03oM)

A [game I've programmed]() for a gamejam also uses this library.



# Documentation


See `doc/merged._md` or `doc/merged.html` for the merged documentation document.
