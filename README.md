### Hi there 👋

My name is Max Sahm.
On the internet I mostly go by max1220.

You've found my GitHub profile.
On here I mostly put my personal projects that *sometimes* *maybe* **eventually** are useful in some small way.


- ⌨ I’m currently working on PinePhone-related stuff
- 🌕 My programming language of choice is Lua
- 🌊 For Lua I've also learned & now am fluent in C.
- 👊 I’m also writing a lot of Bash scripts ...
- 🌐 I learned HTML when I was 8 and I [still do it](https://max1220.de/css/)
- 🐧 I always use Linux, except sometimes for games. Linux is cool 🕶

I have a homepage at [max1220.de](https://max1220.de).

You can reach me by writing an e-mail to `max@max1220.de`.
I'm a native german speaker, and I'm also fluent in english.
